     <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe from<a href="https://www.101cookingfortwo.com/the-art-of-drummies-oven-baked-chicken/"> 101cookingfortwo website</a> has been one of my favourites for a while now. </p>
        It is quick, easy and deliciuos. All of the ingredients are easy to find.
        Below are the steps and ingredients so you can try it out for yourselves.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>6 Chicken legs</li>
    <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>7:2:1 seasoning</li>
    <li>Oil or baking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425째 convection. If you don't have convection, do 425째 conventional and add a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat dry the legs with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Trim off any extra skin and any loose joint pieces.</li>
        <li>Spice to taste. Here I'm using a light sprinkling of my 7:2:1 seasoning. If you don't have that the just some salt and pepper to taste. Other seasonings at your option. A touch of cayenne is nice.</li>
        <li>Placed on a prepared cooking pan with the thicker part of the chicken leg to the outside. I usually line with aluminum foil to help clean up. A rack elevates the chicken to help all sides cook evenly. You can do it without the rack but better with it. Of course, a heavy spray of PAM on the rack or foil.</li>
        <li>Cook to 185째 plus internal temp. DO NOT STOP SHORT of 185째. About 35 minutes in my oven. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving. They are way too hot to eat right away and will be better after a rest.</li>
    </ol>
