    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is great recipe for roasting pork tenderloin. The best part it only uses 1 pan to cook, so it's very easy to make!
    <p>Keep in mind you need some time to marinate tenderloin before cooking, so plan ahead! Once you try it once, you'll know it's worth the wait.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>For marinade: soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, barbeque sauce, honey (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil, baking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate tenderloin for 1-2 days in the fridge by coating it in the mix of marinade ingredients listed</li>
        <li>Once tenderloin is marinated, take it out and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While pork is warming up, turn the oven to 350 F.
        <li>Preheat cast iron pan on medium until hot</li>
        <li>Add oil and let it heat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tenderloin to the pan - it should start sizzling if oil is hot enough, it's good to use splash guard at this time to prevent splatters. Cook for 5 minutes on each side</li>
        <li>Flip tenderloin once more and move the pan into the oven</li>
        <li>Cook until ready - thermometer should read 150F, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>Once ready, take out of the oven and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
    </ol>
